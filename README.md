# HalalFinder

This will be a web application that allows you to find halal resturants based on your preferred cuisine. I started off this project by creating a PostgreSQL database using ElaphantSQL. I then manually inserted some restaurants and their information into an excel sheet, converted it to cvs, then used the \copy command to insert into the tables. 

As for the tables themselves, I had one table called CuisineType that holds the cuisine ID and the catergory, i.e Afghan, Pakistani, American, etc...

I am using the free tier on elaphantSQL so the amount of storage for the database is limited. My plan is to now connect my database to the Web Program I will be making. Also, I plan on using an API to retrieve the images for the locations. This will help expand the tools used in the project.
