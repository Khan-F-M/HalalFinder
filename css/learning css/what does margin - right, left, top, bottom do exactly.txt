In CSS, the "margin" property is used to specify the space around an element. The "margin" property can take one,
	two, three, or four values, which represent the margin for the top, right, bottom, and left sides of an element
	respectively.

The "margin" property creates space around an element, it doesn't make the element smaller. When you set a margin
	value for an element, it creates empty space around the element, pushing it away from other elements on the page.

For example, if you set a margin of 20px for an element, it will create 20px of space between the element and the
	other elements around it. So the element itself will remain the same size, but it will be positioned further
	away from other elements on the page.

It's also worth noting that margins can be negative, which means they will collapse and the elements will overlap.

Also, the space created by margins is transparent and it is outside the element's box, unlike padding which is inside
	the element's box and it's background color is the same as the element's background color.
