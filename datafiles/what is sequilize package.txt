Sequelize is a JavaScript Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library that can be used in any Node.js application. 
	It provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with a database and allows you to write JavaScript
	code to perform common database operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

One of the main advantages of using an ORM like Sequelize is that it abstracts away the underlying SQL commands
	and allows you to interact with the database using JavaScript. This can make your code more readable and
	maintainable, as well as allowing you to write code that is more expressive and easy to understand.

Additionally, Sequelize provides a powerful set of tools for working with databases, including support for complex
	queries, transactions, and migrations. It also supports multiple database management systems, including MySQL,
	MariaDB, SQLite, and PostgreSQL.

It would come in handy in any Node.js application that requires database interaction. For example, it could be used
	in web applications, web APIs, and command-line tools to perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations
	on a database. It could also be used in a back-end service that needs to store and retrieve data from a database.

In summary, Sequelize is a useful tool for developers who are building Node.js applications that require database
	interaction. It provides a powerful and easy-to-use interface for working with databases, and it abstracts
	away the complexity of SQL commands, making it easy to write expressive and maintainable code.
