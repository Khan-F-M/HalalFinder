The fetch in the main.js is not working and keeps being blocked. I don't know why that is since the link alone, in the search bar
with a hardcoded value works fine. The issue has something to do with a thing called CORS. I don't know what that is...

The Error Chrome gives me: 

Error fetching data:  TypeError: Failed to fetch
    at loadRestaurants (main.js:15:5)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:43:5)

SOLUTION: OH MY GOD...I WAS MISSING THE CORS LIBRARY IN THE SERVER FILE. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT MIDDLEWARE AND I'LL HAVE TO
		DO MORE RESEARCH FOR IT....AHHHHH

MORE ON IT: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers. 
    It restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that 
    served the web page.

The cors package in JavaScript is a Node.js package that helps you configure your server
    to handle CORS requests. It adds specific headers to the response of an HTTP request,
    which the browser then uses to determine if the request is allowed. With the cors package,
    you can configure your server to allow requests from specific domains, or from all domains,
    which enables cross-origin communication in a controlled manner. This can be useful when building
    an API that will be consumed by a web application running on a different domain

The simplest form of CORS middleware for express.js in node.js can be implemented using the cors library:
	const express = require('express')
	const cors = require('cors')
	const app = express()

	app.use(cors())

This implementation allows all origins to access the API. You can also specify options to restrict the origins
that are allowed to access the API.
