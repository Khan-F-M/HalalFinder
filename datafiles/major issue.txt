The fetch in the main.js is not working and keeps being blocked. I don't know why that is since the link alone, in the search bar
with a hardcoded value works fine. 

The Error Chrome gives me: 

Error fetching data:  TypeError: Failed to fetch
    at loadRestaurants (main.js:15:5)
    at HTMLDocument.<anonymous> (main.js:43:5)

SOLUTION: ...Don't have one yet...
