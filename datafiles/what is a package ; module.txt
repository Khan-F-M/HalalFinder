Anything you install using npm (Node Package Manager) is called a package or module.

When you install a package using npm, it is downloaded to your computer and added to a folder called
	"node_modules". Each package can contain one or more JavaScript files, as well as other resources
	such as images or documentation.

You can use the packages you have installed by requiring them in your JavaScript files. For example,
	you might use the following command to include a package called "lodash" in your code:

const _ = require('lodash');
Once you have required a package, you can use the functions and objects it exports in your code.

In summary, anything you install using npm is called a package, and you can use the package by
	requiring it in your javascript file and utilizing the functionalities it exports.
