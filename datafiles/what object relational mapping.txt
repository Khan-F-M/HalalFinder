Imagine you have a set of building blocks and each block represents a piece of information. 
	In a database, these blocks are called "tables" and they store information in a structured
	way, like a spreadsheet.

Object Relational Mapping (ORM) is like a translator that helps your computer understand the blocks
	and how they relate to each other. It's like having a guide that can speak the language of the
	blocks and can tell your computer how to use them.

For example, let's say you have two tables: one for students and one for classes. The student table
	might have information like a student's name and age, and the class table might have information
	like the class name and teacher. ORM helps the computer understand that each student is in one or
	more classes and that each class has one or more students.

ORM also helps the computer to interact with the database in an object-oriented way, which means you can
	use code to create, read, update and delete the information in the tables, as if you were working
	with real objects, like real students and classes in the real world.

So ORM is like a guide that helps your computer understand and interact with the building blocks (tables)
	in a database, using the language of code.
